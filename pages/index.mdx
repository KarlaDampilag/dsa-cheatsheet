Arrays are great, but it's not the only data structure available. Besides, if you only know how to use a hammer, you'll treat everything as if it's a nail. That's what my professor told me before he taught us about design patterns. It obviously applies to data structures and algorithms too.

## Developer upgrade 🏋️

There's something extremely fulfilling about mastering your craft... Something about puting your head down, filling in your knowledge gaps, and being the best version of your (programmer) self.

## Write optimized code ⚡️

Writing code that works is one thing. Writing code that's optimized in terms of time and space, by choosing the best data structure and algorithm, is another.

## Open more doors for growth 🤓

To have the opportunity to join and contribute to complex projects means you have to give something valuable in return. That's what continuously improving your skills is for.
