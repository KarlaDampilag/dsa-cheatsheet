# Stack

A stack is a data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Example Use Cases

Stack of books, palindrome, back button for web navigation (which page I was previously on, and so on).

## Stack Methods

1. push
2. pop
3. peek
4. length / size

JavaScript already has these methods, so we can implement stacks using arrays in JS / TS.

## Palindrome TypeScript Example

```typescript
function isPalindrome(word: string): boolean {
	let letters: string[] = [...word]; // this is our stack, put letters of word into stack
	let reverseWord: string = "";
	
	// pop off the stack in reverse order, and store to reverseWord
	for (const letter of word) {
		reverseWord += letters.pop(); 
	}

	return word === reverseWord;
}
```

## TODO
Implement a stack in TypeScript (not needed irl because array data structure has the stack methods, but useful to understand under the hood)
