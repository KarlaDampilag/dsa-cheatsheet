# Stack

A stack is a data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Example Use Cases

Stack of books, reversing an order (e.g. palindrome problem), back button for web browser, any page navigation (which page I was previously on, and so on), undoing commands.

## Stack Methods

1. push - adds an item to the "top" or end of the stack.
2. pop - removes the last item from the stack and returns that item.
3. peek - returns the last item without removing it from the stack.
4. length / size

JavaScript already has these methods, so we can implement stacks using arrays in JS / TS, except for peek(), which you have to do manually by doing `stack[stack.length - 1]`

## Palindrome TypeScript Example

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as it is forward. Examples are "madam" and "racecar".

```typescript
function isPalindrome(word: string): boolean {
	let letters: string[] = [...word]; // this is our stack, put letters of word into stack
	let reverseWord: string = "";
	
	// pop off the stack in reverse order, and store to reverseWord
	for (const letter of word) {
		reverseWord += letters.pop(); 
	}

	return word === reverseWord;
}
```

Depending on the problem requirements, the above function can be modified to ignore spaces in order to check for phrases, and not just words, e.g. "nurses run".

## Palindrome Implementation in TypeScript

Not needed irl because the array data structure has the stack methods, but it's useful to understand under the hood.

```typescript
interface IStack<T> {
	push(item: T): void;
	pop(): T | undefined;
	peek(): T | undefined;
	size(): number;
}

class Stack<T> implements IStack<T> {
	private items: T[] = [];

	constructor(...params: T[]) {
		this.items = [...params];
	}

	size(): number {
		return this.items.length;
	}

	push(item: T): void {
		this.items.push(item);
	}

	pop(item: T): T | undefined {
		if (this.size() === 0) {
			return undefined;
		}
		return this.items.pop();
	}

	peek(): T | undefined {
		if (this.size() === 0) {
			return undefined;
		}
		return this.items[this.size() - 1];
	}
}
```

Using the Stack class above, we can create a new stack using:

```typescript
const stack = new Stack<T>();
```

and if we want to use this new Stack class in our palindrome solution, then the `letters` variable can be declared and instantiated using:

```typescript
let letters = new Stack<string>(...word);
```

the usage of the stack methods will remain the same.
