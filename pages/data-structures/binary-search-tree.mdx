# Binary Search Tree

Just like [linked list](https://dsa-cheatsheet.vercel.app/data-structures/linked-list), binary search tree is a node-based data structure.

The difference is that each node in a binary search tree has a maximum of two children. All resulting nodes make up the tree.

This data structure also has three key properties:

1. The left subtree of a node must only contain nodes with keys that are lesser than the node's key.
2. The right subtree of a node must only contain nodes with keys that are greater than the node's key.
3. Both left and right subtrees are binary search trees themselves, and they have the above two properties.

Because of these properties of a BST, its operations can skip about half of the tree, instead of having to go through all items until you find your item.

The time complexity of operations is directly proportional to the height of the tree. On average, BST search, insertion and deletion takes O(log n).

Other terms for a binary search tree:

- Ordered binary tree
- Sorted binary tree

The time complexity of operations is directly proportional to the height of the tree. It allows for binary search, which has a fast search, insertion and deletion of items.

Binary search trees can be used to implement dynamic [sets](https://dsa-cheatsheet.vercel.app/data-structures/set), lookup tables and priority [queues](https://dsa-cheatsheet.vercel.app/data-structures/queue), and used in sorting algorithms such as tree sort.
