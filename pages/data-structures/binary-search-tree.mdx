# Binary Search Tree

Just like [linked list](https://dsa-cheatsheet.vercel.app/data-structures/linked-list), binary search tree is a node-based data structure.

The difference is that each node in a binary search tree has a maximum of two children, while a linked list node only has a "next" pointer.

Binary search tree also has three key properties:

1. The left subtree of a node must only contain nodes with keys that are lesser than the node's key.
2. The right subtree of a node must only contain nodes with keys that are greater than the node's key.
3. Both left and right subtrees are binary search trees themselves, and they have the above two properties.

Because of these properties of a BST, its operations can skip about half of the tree, instead of having to go through all items until you find your item.

That makes the time complexity of operations to be directly proportional to the logarithm of the height of the tree. It allows for binary search, which has a fast search, insertion and deletion of items. On average, the search, insertion and deletion operations take O(log n).

Other terms for a binary search tree:

- Ordered binary tree
- Sorted binary tree

## Binary Search Tree vs. Linked List vs. Hash table

| BST                                                            | Hash Table                                                    | Linked List                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Each node can have two sub-nodes                               | Node connections are arbitrary                                | Each node is connected to only one other node, which is the next node in the list |
| Insertion, deletion, and search have O(log n) time complexity  | Insertion, deletion, and search have O(1) time complexity     | Insertion and deletion have O(1) time complexity, while search has O(n)           |
| Sorted/ordered                                                 | Not ordered                                                   | Not ordered                                                                       |

## Binary Search Tree Example Use Cases

Binary search trees can be used to implement dynamic [sets](https://dsa-cheatsheet.vercel.app/data-structures/set), lookup tables and priority [queues](https://dsa-cheatsheet.vercel.app/data-structures/queue), and used in sorting algorithms such as tree sort.
