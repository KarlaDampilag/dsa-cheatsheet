# Set

Set is a data structure that does not contain duplicate items, and the items are ordered by insertion.

## Example Use Cases

Eliminating duplicates, checking the presence of an item in a collection, comparison of two or more lists.

## Set Methods

1. has - checks for the presence of an element.
2. add - inserts a new element if the specified value isn't already in the set.
3. delete - removes the specified element and returns a boolean that asserts whether it was successfully removed or not.
4. values - returns all elements in the set.
5. clear - removes all elements from the set.
6. size - returns the number of values in the set.

JavaScript ES6 (ES2015) has a built-in Set object, which contains all of the methods above (set.size in ES6 is a property and not a method).

However, it does not have all of the common methods that are expected from a set data structure, such as the following:

1. union - returns the combined values of two sets.
2. intersection - returns a new set that contains the common elements in two sets.
3. difference - returns a new set that contains elements from the first set which are not in the second set.
4. symmetric difference - returns a new set that contains elements from the first set which are not present in the second set, and elements of the second set which are not present in the first set.
5. is super set - checks if all elements of subset are present in the set.
