# Linked List

Linked list is used to store a collection of elements dynamically, meaning, it can grow or shrink in size.

It's a data structure where elements are stored in a node. Each node holds two pieces of information:

1. The data itself
2. A reference to the next node

The last node in a linked list contains null in its second field (the field that holds a reference to the next node) because it points to no node at all.

Like arrays and [hash tables](https://dsa-cheatsheet.vercel.app/data-structures/hash-table), linked lists can be used to implement other data structures. Each data strucutre has their pros and cons, so which you should choose depends on your use case.

For example, this is an overview comparison of arrays and linked lists:

| Array                                                                                              | Linked List                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Fixed size (not so much in JS, where arrays are objects and objects have no concept of length)     | Dynamic size                   |
| Inefficient insertion & deletion                                                                   | Efficient insertion & deletion (easily insert & delete without reorganizing existing elements) |
| Has random access (e.g. get element at index N)                                                    | No random access               |
| May result in wasted memory (applies when arrays can only have fixed size)                         | No waste of memory             |
| Sequential access is faster                                                                        | Sequential access is slower    |

## Example Use Cases

Linked list are used when:

- Handling dynamic data elements due to its dynamic size
- Inserting and deleting elements due to its fast insertion and deletion
- You need your elements to point to the next element in the list.

We even used a linked list to implement the [queue data structure](https://dsa-cheatsheet.vercel.app/data-structures/queue).

Since we're talking heavily about JavaScript and TypeScript in this site, we should also know that the DOM uses linked lists to store nodes.

GPS Navigation: A linked list of map data. Travelling from origin to destination is example of traversing through all nodes. Rerouting by a GPS is an example of Add and Remove operations of map data.

## Linked List Methods

1. add(element) - appends the element to the end of the list.
2. insertAt(element, index) - inserts the element at the given index in the list.
3. remove(element) - returns and removes element in the list.
4. removeFrom(index) - returns and removes the element at the given index in the list.
5. indexOf(element) - returns the index of a given element if it's in the list. Otherwise it returns -1;
6. getFirst - returns the head or first element in the list.
7. getLast - returns the tail or last element in the list.
8. size - returns the length of the linked list.
9. clear - empties out the list.
